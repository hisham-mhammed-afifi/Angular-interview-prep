### **Core and Advanced Angular Topics**

1. **Component Design Patterns**:

   - Smart (container) vs. Dumb (presentational) components.
   - Dynamic and reusable component patterns.
   - Component lifecycle hooks and their use cases (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngOnDestroy`).

2. **Change Detection**:

   - Angular's Change Detection Mechanism.
   - Strategies: Default vs. OnPush.
   - Use of `trackBy` with `*ngFor` to optimize DOM updates.
   - Zone.js and its role in Angular.
   - Manual triggering of change detection with `ChangeDetectorRef`.

3. **Angular Material and CDK (Component Dev Kit)**:

   - Customizing themes and styles.
   - Advanced use of Angular Material components (e.g., overlays, tables with pagination and sorting, dynamic dialogs).
   - Drag and Drop, Virtual Scrolling from CDK.
   - Creating accessible applications with Angular Material.

4. **Reactive Programming and RxJS**:

   - Core RxJS concepts: Subjects, Observables, Operators (mergeMap, switchMap, concatMap, forkJoin).
   - Error handling and retry strategies in RxJS.
   - Custom operators.
   - Managing complex asynchronous workflows.

5. **Forms**:

   - Advanced Reactive Forms:
     - Nested FormGroups and FormArrays.
     - Dynamic form creation.
     - Custom and async validators.
   - Performance optimization in large forms.

6. **State Management with NgRx**:

   - Core concepts: Store, Actions, Reducers, Effects, Selectors.
   - Advanced patterns: Entity Adapter, Router Store.
   - Lazy loading NgRx state slices.
   - Testing and debugging NgRx applications (Redux DevTools).

7. **Routing**:

   - Advanced routing configurations:
     - Lazy loading with route preloading strategies.
     - Nested routing and auxiliary routes.
     - Advanced use of Guards (`CanLoad`, `CanActivateChild`).
   - Router events and their practical use cases.

8. **Error Handling and Logging**:

   - Global error handling with `ErrorHandler`.
   - Custom error pages and fallback strategies.
   - Centralized logging services.

9. **Performance Optimization**:

   - AOT compilation and Tree-shaking.
   - Code splitting and lazy loading.
   - Reducing bundle size with differential loading.
   - Optimizing Angular templates (avoiding unnecessary bindings, pipes, etc.).
   - Strategies for dealing with large datasets (e.g., pagination, virtual scrolling).

10. **Directives**:

    - Advanced use of custom structural and attribute directives.
    - Building reusable structural directives like custom `*ifElse`.

11. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:

    - Hierarchical injector tree.
    - Multi-provider tokens.
    - Understanding `Injector` and resolving dependencies dynamically.
    - Token strategies (e.g., InjectionToken, forwardRef).

12. **Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)**:

    - Service workers in Angular.
    - Application caching strategies.
    - Background synchronization and push notifications.

13. **Testing**:

    - Unit testing complex components, directives, and pipes.
    - Mocking services and HTTP calls with `HttpTestingController`.
    - Writing integration tests for Angular Material components.
    - Advanced mocking and spies with Jasmine.

14. **Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)**:

    - Using Angular’s built-in i18n tools.
    - Dynamic language switching and handling multiple locales.
    - Managing pluralization and custom translations.

15. **Custom Pipes**:
    - Building pure and impure pipes.
    - Optimization strategies for frequently used pipes.

### **Tooling and Ecosystem**

1. **Angular CLI and Workspace Configuration**:

   - Customizing `angular.json` for advanced builds.
   - Creating custom builders and schematics.

2. **Webpack**:

   - Understanding Webpack's role in Angular.
   - Extending Webpack configuration in Angular CLI.

3. **TypeScript**:

   - Advanced concepts: Decorators, Generics, Utility Types.
   - Using TypeScript’s `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Readonly` effectively.
   - Enforcing strict typing for Angular templates and components.

4. **Monorepos**:

   - Managing large Angular projects using Nx or Lerna.
   - Sharing libraries and modules across applications.

5. **Integration with Backend**:
   - Managing WebSocket connections in Angular.
   - GraphQL integration (Apollo Angular or similar).
   - Advanced API handling with caching strategies.

### **Cutting-Edge and Specialized Topics**

1. **Custom Angular Libraries**:

   - Building and publishing Angular libraries.
   - Maintaining library compatibility with multiple Angular versions.

2. **Micro-Frontend Architecture**:

   - Angular with Micro Frontends (using Module Federation).
   - Communication and shared state between Micro Frontends.

3. **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**:

   - Angular Universal.
   - Optimizing server-rendered applications.
   - Handling SEO and dynamic metadata.

4. **Web Workers**:

   - Using Web Workers for heavy computations.
   - Integration with Angular's build system.

5. **Dynamic Module Loading**:
   - Loading modules and components dynamically at runtime.
